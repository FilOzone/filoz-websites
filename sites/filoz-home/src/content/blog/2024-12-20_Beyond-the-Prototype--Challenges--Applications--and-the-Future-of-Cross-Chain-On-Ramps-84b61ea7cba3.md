In [our last post](https://medium.com/@filoz/under-the-hood-architecture-and-prototype-of-cross-chain-data-storage-6f8ba2c480d6), we explored the prototype for cross-chain deals and how Filecoin demonstrates that decentralized storage can integrate seamlessly with other blockchains. However, as with any innovative solution, there are challenges to address and opportunities to expand. In this post, we’ll discuss the lessons learned, the obstacles ahead, and the exciting applications that could emerge from this architecture.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

While the prototype showcases a functional system, several hurdles remain for a production-grade implementation:

#### Bridging Latency

The current bridging system, relying on the Axelar network, has latency issues due to Filecoin’s lack of explicit finality. Proofs can take 15–20 minutes to bridge back to the originating chain. The upcoming [**f3 finality upgrade**](https://medium.com/@filoz/finality-unveiled-passive-testing-to-mainnet-launch-of-f3-fast-finality-03e09bc68de5) in Filecoin promises to reduce this delay to just a few minutes.

#### Trust Assumptions

The prototype relies on Axelar’s bridging infrastructure, adding trust assumptions beyond Filecoin. Future iterations could use Filecoin’s native finality features to build bridges that rely solely on the Filecoin network for trust.

#### Provider Contention

The current matchmaking system in the on-ramp contract allows multiple storage providers to compete for the same deal, creating inefficiencies. Implementing single-provider matching (e.g., round-robin or reputation-based selection) would solve this.

#### Buffering Costs

The prototype uses a simple HTTP buffer for data storage before it’s sent to Filecoin. Production systems might explore alternatives like IPFS pinning or integration with existing off-chain on-ramps for better efficiency.

### Applications and Use Cases

Cross-chain on-ramps can unlock a range of innovative applications:

#### 1\. True Storage Markets

With programmable on-chain auctions, storage prices could be dynamically determined based on demand, enabling true market mechanisms.

#### 2\. Enhanced Payment Interfaces

Payment models such as pay-as-you-go or recurring subscriptions could improve user experience.

#### 3\. Repair and Renewal Networks

Proofs of fault or termination could enable automatic data renewal or repair systems, ensuring consistent storage reliability.

#### 4\. Smart Contract Backups

Using Merkle tree translation, smart contracts could purchase Filecoin storage for their own data, creating decentralized backups.

### Scalability and Future Improvements

The future of cross-chain on-ramps lies in scalability. With the development of Filecoin Layer 2 solutions, such as the Interplanetary Consensus Protocol, the system could natively bridge between L1 and L2. This opens the door for faster, cheaper cross-chain integrations.

### Expanding the Ecosystem

#### Filecoin L2 Networks

Hosting the on-ramp on Filecoin L2 could simplify the architecture, eliminating the need for external bridges in certain use cases.

#### Integrating with Boost Nodes

Instead of relying on separate XChain nodes, integrating their functionality directly into Boost nodes could streamline operations for storage providers.

#### FIL+ Incentives

Incorporating FIL+ incentives into the system could encourage storage providers to participate in cross-chain deals while improving data cap utilization.

### The Road Ahead

The cross-chain on-ramp prototype has demonstrated its potential to simplify decentralized storage for web3 users, enhance revenue streams for storage providers, and inspire builders to create new applications. The Filecoin ecosystem can unlock new possibilities for verifiable, decentralized storage by addressing the challenges and building on its foundations.
